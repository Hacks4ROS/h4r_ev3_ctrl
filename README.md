# h4r_ev3_ctrl

:warning: **ATTENTION! THE EV3_MANAGER NODE IS SUPPOSED TO RUN ON THE EV3 BRICK DIRECTLY!** :warning:

:question: Having problems with my software? Please use the Github [Issues](https://github.com/Hacks4ROS/h4r_ev3_ctrl/issues) features instead of direct emailing, maybe your problem and solving it can be useful for other users too, thank you... :heart:

Use the image in the instructions - it gives you all except for the launchfiles you should launch on your Linux PC to make the Brick load the controller!

Instructions to get a working image for your SD Card can be found here:

If you want, [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/ROS-Robot-With-Lego-EV3-and-Docker) is a HowTo using Docker Containers created by Mikael Valot.
